          <h3>Mountains</h3>
          <p>
            Nature never fails to impress and surprise us. Nowhere is this more true than when looking at (or better yet, standing on top of) beautiful mountains. 
            In this article I pay tribute to some of earth's most photographic peaks. These may not be the highest mountains in the world but their unique and striking features attract just as much attention. If mountains had a beauty pageant, these stunning ranges would all be winners!

          <h3>Beach</h3>
          <p>
            A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather.

          <h3>WaterFalls</h3>
          <p>
            A waterfall is any point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.
            Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river courses over a top layer.

    <h1>NATURE SERVICES :</h1>
    <p>
      Ecosystem services are the various benefits that humans derive from healthy ecosystems. These ecosystems, when functioning well, offer such things as provision of food, natural pollination of crops, clean air and water, decomposition of wastes, or flood control. Ecosystem services are grouped into four broad categories of services. There are provisioning services, such as the production of food and water. Regulating services, such as the control of climate and disease. Supporting services, such as nutrient cycles and oxygen production. And finally there are cultural services, such as spiritual and recreational benefits.[1] Evaluations of ecosystem services may include assigning an economic value to them.
      For example, estuarine and coastal ecosystems are marine ecosystems that perform the four categories of ecosystem services in several ways. Firstly, their provisioning services include marine resources and genetic resources. Secondly, their supporting services include nutrient cycling and primary production. Thirdly, their regulating services include climate regulation and flood control. Lastly, their cultural services include recreation and tourism.
